Keyless Index
------------------------------

### Problem
Traditionally data that can be looked up is stored in a map with key and value. Imagine we just have a list of objects, we need to convert this back and forth to a map if we have to lookup this based on a particular attribute in the object.
This is not only extra effort for the developer, to write these custom key extractors, it mandates a new compile time structure for every attribute you want to use as a key in the map.

###Solution
We propose the idea of not having a key, instead have a key extractor lambda as a parameter to constructing the data structure. This way the key is derived from the value.
This uses open hashing with linear probing for efficient lookups using an index using an efficient and deterministic hash function.

###Elegance
This makes the storage as simple as possible for every kind of objects, there is no map of map of maps, instead, there is only lists, each element can be an object or a list.

A non unique index is like a multimap, which takes two functions (an index extractor and a pk (primary key) extractor.
A full unique index is like a map, which takes only one function a pk extractor.



###Usage

    NonUniqueIndex nui = new NonUniqueIndex(Person::getId,Person::getName)
    Person george1 = new Person(1,"George")
    Person george2 = new Person(2,"George")
    Person cherian = new Person(3,"Cherian")

    nui.put(george1)
    nui.put(george2)
    nui.put(cherian)

    +----------------+
    | george1|george2|
    +----------------+
    |     cherian    |
    +----------------+

    FullUniqueIndex fui = nui.get(george1)
    Person george2 = fui.get(george2)

###Storage

The Non Unique Index  is just another list of Full Unique Indices.In the above example:
- on index 0 we have a Full Unique Index with two george objects.
- on index 1 we have an single object cherian, as it is unique by index key.
